### Introduction:

As someone want to know what is this car what the model and the price someone how don't know fully information about the car here come our project The objective of this project is to develop an Advanced Car Information System that provides users with detailed information about cars, including the car's name, price, model, color and if it had accident it provide a user-friendly and accessible platform for individuals who lack complete information about a car. This system aims to deliver the following information promptly:

Car Identification: Offer detailed car identification by providing the car's name and model, helping users identify the vehicle accurately.

Pricing Information: Present  pricing information to assist users in gauging the current market value of the car.

Model Identification: Identify the specific model of the car, aiding users in understanding the car's features and specifications.

Color Information: Display the color of the car, allowing users to visualize the vehicle.

 ### Dataset Overview:
