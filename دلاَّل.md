## Introduction

The Advanced Car Information System is a comprehensive platform designed to provide users with detailed information about cars. This system offers a user-friendly interface for individuals seeking accurate and accessible car details. Whether you're looking for the car's name, model, price, or accident history, this project aims to deliver prompt and reliable information.

## Features

### Car Identification

- Detailed car identification including the car's name and model for accurate vehicle recognition.

### Pricing Information

- Presentation of pricing information to assist users in assessing the current market value of the car.

### Model Identification

- Identification of the specific model of the car to provide users with insights into the car's features and specifications.

### Accident History

- Provision of accident history, if applicable, to give users a complete overview of the car's condition.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop an Advanced Car Information System that caters to individuals who may not have complete information about a car. By offering a seamless and intuitive platform, users can effortlessly access vital details about various cars, enabling them to make informed decisions.

 ## Dataset Overview:

- [Used Cars In Saudi Arabia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reemalruqi/used-cars-in-saudi-arabia) : Dataset includes (2287) vehicles information like price, car model, etc.

- [Saudi Arabia Used Cars Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/turkibintalib/saudi-arabia-used-cars-dataset) : Dataset contains 8248 records of used cars collected from syarah.com.

- Car image detection (6 classes)
    - Train: 1500 images
    - Test: 390 images

- Recognition of car accident images
    - Train: 770 images
    - Test: 140 images

### Proposed Algorithms:

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Recognition of car accident images.
- VGG16: Car image detection.
- Random Forest: Predicting car price.

## Final Results and Conclusion:

- Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 93%.
- CNN achieved an accuracy of 82%.
- The VGG16 model achieved an accuracy of 50%, which can be attributed to a deficiency in the amount of data available, falling short of our requirements.
